            Rapidity of transmission is very high for Delta and Omicron, which
            is why in healthcare and crowded settings, it's very important to
            wear an N95 or FFP2 mask.

        <p>
          Make sure you wash your hands for about 20 seconds with soap and
          water. In the absence of soap and water, you can use an alcohol-based
          sanitiser. It is especially important to sanitize after going outdoors
          or touching communal items.

          If you have to be around people, maintain a distance of 2 meters or 6
          feet from others around you as much as possible. In general, any
          gathering of over ten people should be avoided or conducted virtually.

      <h1 id="MISCONCEPTIONS">MYTHS vs FACTS</h1>
      <div class="myth_cont1">
        <ul>
          <li>Alcohol-based sanitizers safe to use for everyone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>FACT:</em>Alcohols in the sanitizers have not been shown to create
          any relevant health issues. Little alcohol is absorbed into the skin,
          and most products contain an emollient to reduce skin dryness.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="myth_cont2">
        <ul>
          <li>It is better to use hand-sanitizers than wear gloves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>FACT:</em>Wearing gloves risks transferring germs from one surface
          to another and contaminating your hands when removing them. Wearing
          gloves does not replace cleaning hands.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="myth_cont3">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Omicron variant is more contagious than previous variants.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>FACT:</em>Scientists say that Omicron is more contagious, but it
          doesn't appear to transmit in ways that are different from earlier
          versions of the virus. That means the same precaution rules apply but
          become more important, even if you are vaccinated or have been
          infected before. Symptoms of this variant also seem to be milder than
          those of previous ones.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="myth_cont4">
        <ul>
          <li>Healthy, young adults cannot be affected by COVID.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>MYTH:</em>Older people and younger people can be infected by the
          COVID-19 virus, but the infection is usually more severe for old and
          very young people. Some people, on the other hand, experience very
          mild symptoms. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect
          themselves from the virus, or example by following good hand hygiene
          and good respiratory hygiene.
        </p>

      <div class="myth_cont5">
        <ul>
          <li>COVID can be spread through 5G networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>MYTH:</em>Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks.
          COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected
          person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by
          touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose.
